#Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

**End-to-End Data Analytics Portfolio Project**

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **complete, industry-standard data analytics workflow** using retail customer shopping data. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior patterns and translating data into **actionable business insights** that support strategic decision-making.

The project simulates real-world responsibilities of a **Data Analyst**, covering data preparation, analysis, visualization, and reporting using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**.

## Business Problem

A retail company aims to improve sales performance, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty by gaining deeper insights into customer shopping behavior.

The company wants to understand:

* Changes in purchasing patterns across customer demographics
* Performance differences between online and offline sales channels
* The impact of discounts, reviews, seasons, and payment preferences
* Factors influencing repeat purchases and customer retention

### Key Business Question

**How can consumer shopping data be leveraged to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?**

## Objectives

* Analyze customer purchasing behavior and preferences
* Identify high-value customers and repeat purchase patterns
* Evaluate the impact of discounts and payment methods on sales
* Provide data-driven recommendations for marketing and product optimization

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis
* **SQL** – Business analysis, segmentation, and querying transactional data
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and insight visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis documentation and reproducibility

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

* Data ingestion and inspection
* Handling missing values and inconsistencies
* Feature engineering for analytical use
* Exploratory analysis to identify trends and anomalies

### 2. Data Analysis (SQL)

* Load cleaned data into a relational database
* Execute analytical SQL queries to answer business questions:

  * Customer segmentation
  * Repeat vs one-time buyers
  * Revenue contribution by customer type
  * Channel and payment method performance

### 3. Data Visualization (Power BI)

* Design an interactive dashboard to visualize:

  * Sales and revenue trends
  * Customer demographics
  * Channel performance (online vs offline)
  * Product category insights

### 4. Reporting & Insights

* Summarize findings in a structured report
* Translate analytical results into business-focused recommendations
* Present insights clearly for non-technical stakeholders
